# ðŸ§ª Research Projects

## 1. Dopamine Driving through Dashboard (DDD2EEE)

**Summary:**  
The *Dopamine Driving through Dashboard* (DDD) project aims to develop centralized, interactive dashboards that drive motivation and engagement among stakeholders in educational research and development. Built using the **MERN stack**, DDD visualizes project progress, participation, and analytics across multiple initiatives at the **DLED Lab**, enabling data-informed decision-making.

**Research Team:**  
- Sakshi Sharma (Ph.D. Scholar, CSE, under Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar)

**Timeline:**
- Ideation: July 2023  
- Version Zero (basic prototype): August 2023  
- Full-fledged prototype development: May 2025  
- Tentative Completion: December 2025

**Key Outcomes:**
- Modular dashboard system for live tracking of research and product initiatives  
- Improved visibility into student/faculty engagement and contributions  
- Scalable design supporting multiple datasets and real-time visualisation

**Collaborations:**
- VIBE Project  
- PES  
- Poll Automation

## 2. Poll Automation

**Summary:**  
The *Poll Automation* project is a real-time classroom intelligence system designed to enhance interactivity in live teaching sessions. By leveraging **live audio transcripts**, the web application listens to ongoing lectures, generates summaries, and automatically crafts contextual polls every five minutes (adjustable by the instructor). This fosters continuous engagement, checks comprehension, and provides instructors with live feedback loops.

**Research Team:**  
- Sakshi Sharma (Ph.D. Scholar, IIT Ropar, under Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar)  
- Rohit Sharma (Ph.D. Scholar, IIT Ropar, under Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar)  
- Meenakshi (Ph.D. Scholar, IIT Ropar, under Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar)

**Timeline:**
- Ideation: February 2025  
- Script-based Prototype: February â€“ April 2025  
- Tentative Completion: December 2025

**Key Outcomes:**
- Real-time speech-to-text transcription system for live classes  
- Automated, context-aware poll generation with instructor override features  
- Seamless integration with dashboards (DDD) and feedback mechanisms (PES)  
- Enhanced classroom interactivity and adaptive teaching support

**Collaborations:**
- DDD for real-time visualization of participation and response trends  
- PES for aligning polls with reflective peer evaluation strategies
